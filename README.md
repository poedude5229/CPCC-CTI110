## CPCC CTI110 Class Work Repository

- This is just my little repo for my class work, beginning on March 17th 2025.
- It would be kinda nice, kinda cute for this to register in my App Academy commit goals as well.
- Maybe a recruiter would see?
- I'm also not using Notepad++ lol everything it can do, VSCode does better. I'm also running Ubuntu so I can't even use Notepad++
